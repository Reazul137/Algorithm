<h1>Algorithm</h1>
<h5>What is algorithm?</h5>
<p>Any special method of solving a certain kind of problem (Webster Dictionary).<br>
An algorithm is "a process, or rules, for mechanical calculation" (Oxford Concise). 
<p>
<h5>What is program?</h5>
<p>A program is the expression of an algorithm in a programming language.
A set of instructions which the computer will follow to solve a problem.
</p>
<h5>Why do we analyze about them?</h5>
<p>1. Understand their behavior, and (Job -- Selection, performance, modify)<br>
2. Improve them. (Research)<br>
3. Correctness. (Does the input/output relation match algorithm requirement?)<br>
4. Amount of work done. (aka complexity), Basic operations to do task.<br> 
5. Amount of space used (Memory used).<br>
6. Simplicity, clarity (Verification and implementation).<br> 
7. Optimality. (Is it impossible to do better?) <br> 
</p>
<h5>Importance of Analyze Algorithm?</h5>
<p>1. Need to recognize limitations of various algorithms for solving a problem.<br>
2. Need to understand relationship between problem size and running time. (When is a running program not good enough?).<br>
3. Need to learn how to analyze an algorithm's running time without coding it.<br>
4. Need to learn techniques for writing more efficient code.<br>
5. Need to recognize bottlenecks in code as well as which parts of code are easiest to optimize.<br>
</p>
<h5>Complexity</h5>
<p>The complexity of an algorithm is simply the amount of work the algorithm performs to complete its task.</p>
<h5>Define Problem</h5>
<p>1. <b>Problem :</b> Description of Input-Output relationship. <br>
2. <b>Algorithm :</b> A sequence of computational step that transform the input into the output.<br>
3. <b>Data Structure :</b> An organized method of storing and retrieving data.<br>
4. <b>Our task :</b> 	Given a problem, design a correct and good algorithm that solves it.<br>
</p>

<h5>Which algorithm is better?</h5>
<p>1. Measure the running time (number of operations needed).<br>
 2. Measure the amount of memory used.<br>
 3. Note that the running time of the algorithms increase as the size of the input increases.<br>
</p>

<h5>Dynamic Programming</h5>
<p>1. It is used, when the solution can be recursively described in terms of solutions to subproblems (optimal substructure).</br>
2. Algorithm finds solutions to subproblems and stores them in memory for later use.</br>
3. More efficient than “brute-force methods”, which solve the same subproblems over and over again.</br>
</p>
<p><b>How it works::</b></br>
 --> dynamic programming solves problems by combining the solutions to sub problem.</br>
--> dynamic programming applies when subproblem overlap.</br>
--> dynamic programming algorithm solves each sub problem must once and then saves its answer in double.</br>
</p>
<p><b>4steps for dynamic programming::</b><br>
1. characterize the structure of an optimal solution.<br>
2. recursively define the value of an optimal solution.<br>
3. compute the value of an optimal solution.<br>
4. construct optimal solution from computed information.<br>
