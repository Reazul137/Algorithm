<h1>Algorithm</h1>
<h5>What is algorithm?</h5>
<p>Any special method of solving a certain kind of problem (Webster Dictionary).<br>
An algorithm is "a process, or rules, for mechanical calculation" (Oxford Concise). 
<p>
<h5>What is program?</h5>
<p>A program is the expression of an algorithm in a programming language.
A set of instructions which the computer will follow to solve a problem.
</p>
<h5>Why do we analyze about them?</h5>
<p>1. Understand their behavior, and (Job -- Selection, performance, modify)<br>
2. Improve them. (Research)<br>
3. Correctness. (Does the input/output relation match algorithm requirement?)<br>
4. Amount of work done. (aka complexity), Basic operations to do task.<br> 
5. Amount of space used (Memory used).<br>
6. Simplicity, clarity (Verification and implementation).<br> 
7. Optimality. (Is it impossible to do better?) <br> 
</p>
<h5>Importance of Analyze Algorithm?</h5>
<p>1. Need to recognize limitations of various algorithms for solving a problem.<br>
2. Need to understand relationship between problem size and running time. (When is a running program not good enough?).<br>
3. Need to learn how to analyze an algorithm's running time without coding it.<br>
4. Need to learn techniques for writing more efficient code.<br>
5. Need to recognize bottlenecks in code as well as which parts of code are easiest to optimize.<br>
</p>
<h5>Complexity</h5>
<p>The complexity of an algorithm is simply the amount of work the algorithm performs to complete its task.</p>
<h5>Define Problem</h5>
<p>1. <b>Problem :</b> Description of Input-Output relationship. <br>
2. <b>Algorithm :</b> A sequence of computational step that transform the input into the output.<br>
3. <b>Data Structure :</b> An organized method of storing and retrieving data.<br>
4. <b>Our task :</b> 	Given a problem, design a correct and good algorithm that solves it.<br>
</p>

<h5>Which algorithm is better?</h5>
<p>1. Measure the running time (number of operations needed).
 2. Measure the amount of memory used.
 3. Note that the running time of the algorithms increase as the size of the input increases.
