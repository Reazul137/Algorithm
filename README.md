</p>
<h5>Why do we analyze about them?</h5>
<p>1. Understand their behavior, and (Job -- Selection, performance, modify)<br>
2. Improve them. (Research)<br>
3. Correctness. (Does the input/output relation match algorithm requirement?)<br>
4. Amount of work done. (aka complexity), Basic operations to do task.<br> 
5. Amount of space used (Memory used).<br>
6. Simplicity, clarity (Verification and implementation).<br> 
7. Optimality. (Is it impossible to do better?) <br>
